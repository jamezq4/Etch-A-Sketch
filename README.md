# Etch-A-Sketch
This project consists of a grid that you can color over. 
You can change the grid size at any time(limit is 100 x 100) and,
pick any color from a color palette to start coloring.
I followed the Odin Project's instructions and commented out the code I used for their instructions.
But I wanted to make this project to be my own and this is how I wanted the project to be like.
